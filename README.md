## Development Environment
For its development, various programs were used, such as inskape and krita for the creation of the characters and Unity as the video game engine.

Unity offers an animator to create character animations

With the sprite editor tool the bones were established

With inkscape the characters were created in vector maps, and then with krita the format was prepared to be recognized by Unity

## Story of my character Kokulice

From a very young age he proved to be a prodigy in martial arts, arousing fear in his family, since legend has it that a person with such talent would overthrow the lord regent who rules with an iron fist. His family hid him for a while, but the rumors reached the Lord, he took it as an act of treason and destroyed the entire city Kokulice managed to save himself due to the sacrifice of his family.

Kokulice was wandering until he passed out from not having eaten or drunk anything in days, he was rescued by a scholar who took him home. When Kokulice recovered, he told him what had happened and how he got there, the scholar shocked by the story asked him for a demonstration of his ability, which he accepted, he was surprised and that's when he revealed his true identity, An'Qira the scholar of fire and in turn decided to take him as an apprentice.

An'Qira told him during training that the Lord was only a subject of a greater enemy and that he would eventually be called upon to face Dorticos. That was how Kokulice trained harder every day until he received the call to his destiny.
